DIRECTIONS: Works like a typical digital alarm clock would. 
You use the two text fields under "Alarm" to enter the hour and the minute values and whether or not it isset to a PM or AM time using the radio buttons and then click the "SET" button to set the alarm to sound at that specific time. 
As you would expect, the "UNSET" button disables the alarm from sounding at that time.
